  <h1>About the Blog</h1>

  <p>
    This blog exists as a living record of <strong>Rio Forever</strong>, our
    year-long celebration of 50 years of community-run cinema at the Rio Cinema.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a space to document the stories, screenings, people and ideas that
    shape the Rio: past, present and future.
  </p>

  <p>
    By sharing memories, archive material and reflections as the programme
    unfolds, the blog helps preserve the cinema’s collective history while
    opening up conversations about what a community cinema can and should be
    for the next 50 years.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Long live the Rio!</strong></p>
